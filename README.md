# Ben's Dotfiles

Ben's dotfiles (all in one place!)

## Setup

To setup all dotfiles on the system

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bitHero/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./bootstrap
```

It's a good idea to put the repository in `~/.dotfiles` as some of the scripts rely on it.

## Docs

Documentation on setting up environments is under `docs`.
